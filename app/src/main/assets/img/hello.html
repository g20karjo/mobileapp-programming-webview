<h1>All Star av Smash Mouth</h1>
<p>Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me<br>
    I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed<br>
    She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb<br>
    In the shape of an "L" on her forehead<br>
    <br>
    Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming<br>
    Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running<br>
    Didn't make sense not to live for fun<br>
    Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb<br>
    So much to do, so much to see<br>
    So what's wrong with taking the back streets?<br>
    You'll never know if you don't go<br>
    You'll never shine if you don't glow<br>
    <br>
    Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play<br>
    Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid<br>
    And all that glitters is gold<br>
    Only shooting stars break the mold<br>
    <br>
    It's a cool place and they say it gets colder<br>
    You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older<br>
    But the meteor men beg to differ<br>
    Judging by the hole in the satellite picture<br>
    The ice we skate is getting pretty thin<br>
    The water's getting warm so you might as well swim<br>
    My world's on fire, how about yours?<br>
    That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored<br>
    <br>
    Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play<br>
    Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid<br>
    All that glitters is gold<br>
    Only shooting stars break the mold<br>
    <br>
    Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play<br>
    Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show, on get paid<br>
    And all that glitters is gold<br>
    Only shooting stars<br>
    <br>
    Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?<br>
    I need to get myself away from this place<br>
    I said, "Yup" what a concept<br>
    I could use a little fuel myself<br>
    And we could all use a little change<br>
    <br>
    Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming<br>
    Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running<br>
    Didn't make sense not to live for fun<br>
    Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb<br>
    So much to do, so much to see<br>
    So what's wrong with taking the back streets?<br>
    You'll never know if you don't go (go!)<br>
    You'll never shine if you don't glow<br>
    <br>
    Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play<br>
    Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid<br>
    And all that glitters is gold<br>
    Only shooting stars break the mold<br>
    <br>
    And all that glitters is gold<br>
    Only shooting stars break the mold.</p>
